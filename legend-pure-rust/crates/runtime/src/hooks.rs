//! Evaluator hooks for debugging and instrumentation.
//!
//! The evaluator is generic over `H: EvalHooks`, enabling zero-cost
//! instrumentation via Rust's monomorphization:
//!
//! - [`NoOpHooks`] — production. Every method is `#[inline(always)]` and
//!   compiles to nothing. Used by CLI, JNI, and batch execution.
//! - `DebugHooks` (future, in `lsp` crate) — IDE debugging with breakpoints,
//!   stepping, and variable inspection. Maintains a live call stack and
//!   coordinates with the DAP server.
//!
//! # Design rationale
//!
//! Rather than using dynamic dispatch (`dyn EvalHooks`) or feature flags,
//! we use a generic parameter so the compiler can eliminate all hook calls
//! in production builds via monomorphization. This gives us **zero overhead**
//! on the hot path while keeping the evaluator debugger-aware from day one.

/// - Breakpoint checking and pause/resume coordination

/// - Expression tracing / logging
