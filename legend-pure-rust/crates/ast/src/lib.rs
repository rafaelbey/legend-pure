//! # Legend Pure Parser — AST
//!
//! Core data model for the Pure grammar parser. This crate defines all AST types
//! used to represent parsed Pure source code. It has zero serialization dependencies
//! and is designed for direct consumption by both the protocol crate (for Protocol JSON output)
//! and a future Rust-based compiler.
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! - **Everything is `Spanned`** — every AST node carries a [`SourceInfo`] for precise error
//!   reporting and IDE integration. No node exists without a known source position.
//! - **No `serde`** — AST is a pure data model, serialization lives in the protocol crate
//! - **Immutable** — All types are constructed once during parsing, never mutated
//! - **Type-safe** — Rust enums with data, not stringly-typed maps
//! - **Compiler-ready** — AST ≠ Protocol JSON; designed for parser efficiency and future compiler use
